This is a simple C++ console game that simulates a penalty shootout between you and the computer. The game consists of 5 rounds, where both teams take turns shooting and goalkeeping.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Each round, you choose the direction to kick or dive:
  - `1` → Bottom Right  
  - `2` → Bottom Left  
  - `3` → Top Right  
  - `4` → Top Left  

- The computer randomly picks a direction.
- If both pick the same direction, it’s a save (`❌`).
- If not, it's a goal (`⚽`).
